# Phone Number-Validation 
This code is for checking all Pakistani mobile numbers for validity. The workflow is very simple, you just need to have an input field for the mobile number to be typed in with a class of 'phoneNumber' and type='tel'. Next wrap the error-message in a <small> tag with a class of 'phoneNumberError'. And lastly, add a class of 'form-submit' to the form-submit button.
